## BALANCE - A Demo Programming Language

I built this project as a hobby and to learn the inner workings of a compiler such as parser, lexer, syntax tree and so on.
As of now, I don't have any vision on how it is going to go in future, but if anyone else is also learning to build compiler/interpreter/transpilers, you can feel free to contribute.

## Installation

- Run `cargo run -q` to play on the balance REPL
